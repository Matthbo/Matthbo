### Hi there, I'm Vivy <sub>_(They/Them)_</sub>

Graduated Software Engineer at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences.  
A web developer (most of the time).
Currently reimagining and tinkering on the [Frank!Framework](https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework).

Most projects are either for school or personal projects that I like to work on.  
I will probably not maintain them anymore if they don't interest me, but feel free to look around! âœ¨
